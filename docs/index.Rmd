title: "CPFMove Introduction"
---

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```

This document is intended to provide basic information on how to use the CPFMove functions. This package is designed to work with raw GPS data and especially for species showing a central-place foraging behavior (CPF i.e. tendancy to an animal to leave and return to a fixed based between foraging trips, rather than being in constant roaming). The package has three main objectives:

Falilitating the delineation of trip from raw GPS data for CPF species
Offering basic tools for filtering/enhancing the quality of the trips
Offering basic diagnostic tools for parameter selection
Offering a basic plotting function to visually assessed the reliability of delineated tracks

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
pathM <- c("C:/Users/philip/OneDrive/NP_Kontrakt/R/DummyMeta/")
metname <- c("METADATA_dummy.csv")
metafile <- read.csv(paste(pathM, metname, sep=""), sep = ",", header=T, na.strings=c("","NA"))
```

## Data Format

The algortihm rely on a local metadata file that contains the information necessary to accurately delineating trips. Nine arguments are necessary for delineating trips (see below). Although this information is mandatory, the algorithm is flexible in regards of column’s names and can be specified accordingly in the main function

Clongitude: The colony longitude (WGS84)
Clatitude: The colony latitude (WGS84)
MetalRing: The unique identifier of the captured bird
GPSType: The type of GPS used
FIX: The programmed sampling interval of the GPS
Deployment: The standardized deployment date
Recapture: The standardized recapture date
UTC_Deployment: Standardized time of the deployment (UTC recommended)
UTC_Retrieval: Standardized time of the recapture (UTC recommended)

```{r cars, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
head(metafile)
```

## Trip Delineation

Trip delineation is performed via the filt() function. The function has many arguments which among those, 5 has filtering effect (see ?filt() for the corresponding details);

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=F}

f <- filt(pathF, pathM, metname, timezone, speedTresh = 22.222, gpst = "GPSType",
      ddep = "deployment", drecap = "recapture", colony = "colony", year = "year",
      ring = "ring", FIX = "FIX", tdep = "utc_deployment", trecap = "utc_retrieval",
      BuffColony = 0.5, MinTripDur = 60, Complete = T, FixInt = 2,
      Interpolate = T, filtNA = 1, metINFO = c("ring", "year", "colony"), splt = F)

```

The main purpose of this package is to facilitate the delineation of foraging trips from raw GPS data.Trip delineation is however a relatively flexible procedure and rely essentially on how we define “spatially” the colony.

The colony radius is the main parameter for delineation (see BuffColony). In other words, this treshold (km) is used to build an area around the colony’s centroid. From that area, all locations falling inside will be categorized as “colony” locations and those falling outside as “trip” ones. This binary category will thereafter be used for segmenting each foraging trip, i.e. having the last point in the colony before departure and the first point at the colony at arrival

Investigating effect of filtering options
The BuffColony options have an important effect on the resulting trip dataset. This package has two functions for investigating such effect. These functions are essentially bootstrap where variation within scenario are computed. These normally described a decaying function of the number of final trips along increment of the radius size of the colony and the minimal duration that a trip should have. The second rate of change is also computed, among means of the different bootstrapping scenario. User can thus decide of a certain treshold to show where the variation among scenario “stabilize”.

Below an example of sensitivity of the response over a serie of radius scenario.In that example, the optimal radius has been chosen as XXX km. Using the second order rate of change (SORC), this scenario revealed to have an absolute variation of less than 5% of the maximum average value of the scenario tested (i.e. ca. 13.7, corresponding to a SORC of < 13.7*0.05)

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("sc_plot.png")

```
Which parameters selection is highly dependable of the species under investigation and its relative behavior. The function has in total 5 filtering options, which will impact to a varying extent the final outputs:

Speed filtering is available (see speedTresh) and will remove locations associated to a upper speed level. The function use the function developped by Freitas et al. 2008 from the package “argosfilter”. This function is itself based on the approach suggested by McConnell et al. 2002, except in case where the relevant point is wihtin a distance of 5 km from the previous fix. See references in the ?filt() documentation
Minimum trip length is a parameter to filterate very small trips, corresponding to bathing trip, resting at some distance of the colony or visiting neighbors. This parameter is in minutes (see MinTripDur).
One can filterate trip as function of the number of points generated after interpolation. In other words, many tracks have many missing points and a tracks composed from 90% interpolatde points might not have the same representativity than another one that have only 10%. This function let user to disciminate based on a certain treshold (see filtNA)

Finally, on can also filterate as function of the completeness of the tracks (see Complete). Depending of the question and data representation, one could decide to only use complete trips for his/her analyses
Interpolation is executed by adehabitatLT::redisltraj().If you want to add additional data to the final objects, these one needs to could be easily attached from the metadata, using the metINFO = c(“ring”, “year”, “colony”) object. The option splt let you split the final object into an array instead of a data frame. In case the splt is set to TRUE, the object can be unsplitted thereafter using do.call(rbind, object)

## Plotting the delineated trips
  
The script has now produced one object containing the segmented trips. One way to visualize those trips is to pass them into the plottingMAP() function;

Using object from CPFmove class, the function plots each trip with the colony (blue) distinctive of the trip’s locations (purple). The function use the basemap() from the ggOceanMaps package in its pipeline. If mulitple trips are given, the function will make

The script codes now for plotting only the first bird from the splitted object (see splt object from the filt());

```{r, echo= F, results = "hide", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

plotMAP <- function(allbirds, pmap = FALSE, path = NULL, w = 12, h = 12,
                units = "cm", ColLong = NULL, ColLat = NULL) {
  
  if (is.null(path))
    stop("path? You need to indicate where to save the figures")
  
  pack <- c("ggOceanMaps", "ggplot2", "ggspatial")
  
  if (length(setdiff(pack, rownames(installed.packages()))) > 0) {
    install.packages(setdiff(pack, rownames(installed.packages())))  
  }
  
  sapply(pack, function(p) {require(p, quietly=T, character.only = T)})
  
  allbirds <- do.call(rbind, allbirds)
  
  for(i in 1:length(unique(allbirds$birdTrip))){
    
    bt <- unique(allbirds$birdTrip)[i]
    
    bird <- subset(allbirds, allbirds$birdTrip == bt)
    
   if (is.null(ColLong) | is.null(ColLat)) {
    warning("You have no coordinate associated to your colony. Location will be automatically picked up from your dataset")
    
    ColonyPos <- subset(bird, bird$ColonyorTrip == "colony")
     
    m <- basemap(limits = c(min(bird$Longitude), max(bird$Longitude), 
          min(bird$Latitude), max(bird$Latitude)), bathymetry = TRUE, 
          glaciers = TRUE, bathy.style = "poly_greys") +
        geom_spatial_path(data = bird, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude), color = "light gray") +

        geom_spatial_point(data = ColonyPos[1, ], aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude), color = "blue")
    
    } else {
      
    m <- basemap(limits = c(min(bird$Longitude), max(bird$Longitude), 
          min(bird$Latitude), max(bird$Latitude)), bathymetry = TRUE,

    }
    
    g <- paste0('MAP_', bt, '.png')
    ggsave(m, filename = g, bg = "transparent", path = path, width = w, height = h, units = units) 
    
    if(pmap == TRUE){ return(m + ggtitle(g))}
    
    ColonyPos <- NULL
